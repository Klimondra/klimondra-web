I am studying IT and programming at the High School of Applied Cybernetics in Hradec Králové. Computers and software have fascinated me since I was a child. Around the age of thirteen, I started learning to create websites using HTML and CSS and gradually tried other technologies, such as Python or C#.\n\nCurrently, I am actively learning to program and expanding my knowledge in both Frontend and Backend development. I also try to move forward outside of school in my free time, because I enjoy discovering new technologies, looking for effective solutions and moving forward.",

I still maintain the website and occasionally write articles and news there. While creating it, I refreshed my experience with WordPress, and once again convinced myself that I won't be touching WordPress again for a while :)"
